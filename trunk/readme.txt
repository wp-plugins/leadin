== Description ==

= Get to know your website visitors =

= Find out who's on your site and what they're doing =
When someone visits your site, you want to know more about them. What pages they've visited, when they return, and what social networks they’re on. Leadin gives you the details you need to make your next move.

= More context for your conversations =
Leadin automatically finds publicly available information about each of your contacts. Details such as location, work history, and company info can give you more context when you reach out.

= Convert more visitors to contacts =
Use the optional popup form to prevent people from slipping through the cracks. The popup also uses the contact data to intelligently know when to appear.

= Keep your contacts in sync with your email tool =
Leadin syncs your contacts to an email list of your choice without replacing any forms.

= Find out what content and traffic sources convert the best =
Our simple analytics show you what sources of traffic and content are driving the most contacts. No more complicated Google Analytics reports.

= How does it work? =

1. When you activate the WordPress plugin, Leadin will track each anonymous visitor to your site with a cookie.
2. Leadin automatically identifies and watches each existing form on your site for submissions.
3. Once someone fills out any other form on your site, Leadin will identify that person with their email address. and add them to your contact list.
4. You'll also receive an email with a link to the new contact record with all of their visit history. (check the screenshots sections to see it in action)

= Who's using Leadin? =

**<a href="http://www.extremeinbound.com/leadin-wordpress-crm-inbound-plugin/" target="_blank">Alan Perlman</a>**: *“I can use Leadin to get a sense of how engaged certain contacts are, and I can learn more about their behavior on my website to better drive the conversation and understand what they’re interested in or looking for.”*

**<a href="http://thewpvalet.com/wordpress-lead-tracking/" target="_blank">Adam W. Warner</a>**: *“…the Leadin plugin has been very useful so far in giving us an idea of the actual visitor paths to our contact forms vs. the paths we’ve intended.”*
