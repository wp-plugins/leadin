LeadIn is an easy-to-use marketing automation and lead tracking plugin for WordPress that helps you better understand your web site visitors.

== Description ==

= Get personal with your leads =

<a href="http://leadin.com" alt="WordPress marketing automation and lead tracking plugin">LeadIn</a> is an easy-to-use marketing automation and lead tracking plugin for WordPress that helps you better understand your web site visitors.

When a person submits a form on your WordPress site, you want to know more about them. What pages they've visited, when they return, and what social networks they’re on. Our WordPress marketing automation and lead tracking plugin gives you the details you need to make your next move. Because business isn’t business unless it’s personal.

= How does it work? =

1. When you activate the WordPress plugin, LeadIn will track each anonymous visitor to your site with a cookie. If someone closes the pop-up or subscribes, we won't show them the pop-up again.
2. Once someone fills out the subscribe form or any other other form on your site, LeadIn will identify that person with their email address.
3. You'll receive an email with a link to the new contact record with all of their visit history.

= Who's using LeadIn? =


**Alan Perlman**: *“I can use LeadIn to get a sense of how engaged certain contacts are, and I can learn more about their behavior on my website to better drive the conversation and understand what they’re interested in or looking for.”*
